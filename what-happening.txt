we want our IoT to publish MQTT messages to topic "root/main" and it sends it in a JSON format where the JSON fields are { "ao-processes" : "here can be multiple ao process addresses seperated by comma", "data" : "this is message that is getting publish to root/main topic", "where-to-find-me" : "this is the topic that our iot is suscribed to and this is where our process will give back the topic to the server and server will publish to this topic"  }.

okay now our express server is a router that sits in between the IoT deivce and AO processes to make them communicate, this server is suscribed to topic "root/main" so that it can get the messge from IoT, sever takes the message and sends it to a mother process id "qlZzUmdg7rsduKeYLxd0T1DZSITOtA9KqmWQFTZlWfI" so the express server and mother process are the one that helps creating this communication, so once the message is recived by our express router it reads the json and sends the message to our mother process and our mother process will send message to all the process whos id was mention in the json"
